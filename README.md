# Tasks list [PL language]

## My first tasks list which is based on YouCode course.
You can add new tasks, mark them as done and then remove from the list.

### Technologies used:
HTML,
Java Script,
CSS (BEM, GRID), 
Immutability

### Check demo and make your list for today! :wink: https://anna-malik.github.io/tasks-list/
